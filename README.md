# Optimizing Healthcare Analytics: A Zero-Inflated Poisson Approach to Pediatric Emergency Room Visits
This project systematically compares the performance of Poisson regression and Zero-inflated Poisson regression models in analyzing count data, emphasizing the common issue of overdispersion. Through an evaluation using Mean-Squared Error (MSE), it establishes that the Zero-inflated Poisson regression model proves superior in addressing the specific challenge of excess zero counts, particularly evident in the analysis of hospital emergency room visits by children aged between 10-18.
